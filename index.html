            "I have worked in the technical service industry for 14 years after getting a degree in Advanced Technology. I worked with both commercial and residential heating, cooling/air conditioning, refrigeration, and surgical equipment including laser. During this time I have worked directly with customers and trained employees. Recently working in the medical sector as a technician I found I was ready to move on to something else and into a field where I can learn something new and grow. I have always been into computers, gaming, and tech, but the software is something I knew very little about. I decided to challenge myself and after recently getting married I decided to go back to school and learn software development. I am excited to get into the tech field and start a new diverse career.
